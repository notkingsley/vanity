This document describes the AUTH-related commands and responses.

## Auth commands
Note: none of these commands are allowed in a PIPE request.

- `ADD_USER<username><password>`
    Adds a new user to the server.
    An OK response indicates success, an ERROR response indicates failure, with the <body> containing the reason.
    A DENIED response is returned if the requesting client is not an ADMIN.

    <username> is the username to authenticate with, a <string>, minimum 4 characters,
    <password> is the password to authenticate with, a <string>, minimum 4 characters.

    Example:
    ```
    ADD_USER (5)user1 (5)password1
    OK
    ```

- `AUTH<username><password>`
    Authenticates with the server.
    An OK response indicates success, an ERROR response indicates failure, with the <body> containing the reason.
    This can only be done once per connection. Subsequent attempts will receive a DENIED response.

    <username> is the username to authenticate with, a <string>,
    <password> is the password to authenticate with, a <string>.

    Example:
    ```
    AUTH (5)user1 (9)password1
    OK
    ```

- `CHANGE_PASSWORD<new_password>`
    Changes the password of the currently authenticated user.
    An OK response indicates success, an ERROR response indicates failure, with the <body> containing the reason.

    Only authenticated users can change their password.
    The password cannot be changed for another user.

    <new_password> is the new password to set, a <string>, minimum 4 characters.

    Example:
    ```
    CHANGE_PASSWORD (5)pass1
    OK
    ```

- `DEL_USER<username>`
    Deletes a user from the server.
    An OK response indicates success, an ERROR response indicates failure, with the <body> containing the reason.
    A DENIED response is returned if the requesting client is not an ADMIN.

    Note that a user cannot delete themself.
    If any client is currently connected with the user being deleted, they will be disconnected on the next request.

    <username> is the username to authenticate with, a <string>

    Example:
    ```
    DEL_USER (5)user1
    OK
    ```

- `EDIT_USER<username><auth_level>`
    Edits a user's authentication level.
    An OK response indicates success, an ERROR response indicates failure, with the <body> containing the reason.
    A DENIED response is returned if the requesting client is not an ADMIN.

    <username> is the username to authenticate with, a <string>
